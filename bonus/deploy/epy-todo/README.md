# Epy Todo - The full stack version

## About

Epy is a simple to-do list web application built with node.js and MariaDB
The Full-stack version implements an HTML/CSS/JavaScript interface as well as using docker and docker-compose for stability.

## Requirements

for this project you will need:

- Docker
- Docker-compose
- A web Browser (tested browsers: Chrome, Firefox)

If you are under Mac or Windows, Docker desktop already comes with the required elements

## All set! Go

In order to launch the program double-click on the RUN_ME file located in the same folder as the project:

- For Linux and Mac users:
  - Open a terminal in this folder
  - Run: `chmod +x RUN_ME.sh`
  - Run: `sudo ./RUN_ME.sh`
- For Windows users:
  - Double click on the `RUN_ME.bat` file

If you think your file did not work:

- Run: `sudo docker-compose up` in a terminal open in this folder for non Windows users.
- Run:  `docker-compose up` in a terminal open in this folder for Windows users.

Once the Window's text that appeared (for Windows users) has come to a halt, you can access the website at: [localhost](http://localhost:80)
